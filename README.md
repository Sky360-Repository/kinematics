# kinematics
overlay_pred_to_video.py uses a time series classification model to predict the object type (for now only planes, birds and plants) based on the object's movement and speed. The prediction is overlaid on the video.
The notebook training_data_model_fit.ipynb can be used to generate input data for model training, fitting and testing time series classification models.
